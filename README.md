# 🚗 Car Price Prediction Web Application

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a machine learning based web application that predicts the selling price of used cars.  
Users can select different trained machine learning models, enter car details, and receive real time price predictions through an interactive dashboard.

The application is developed using Python and Streamlit, with models trained using scikit learn.  
A modern and premium user interface is implemented using custom HTML and CSS within Streamlit.

The application is deployed on Streamlit Cloud and accessible via a web browser.
